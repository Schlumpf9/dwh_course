The Git repository contains the source Code for my DWH lecture at Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW).

The slides can be found at http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~buckenhofer/ or at slideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/AndreasBuckenhofer/

The source code is based on Oracle and has been tested on https://apex.oracle.com/en/ which is available for free. Most part of the source code should also work with (no or small changes with) other RDBMS.
